# Roadmap for completing the assessment and documenting `tasks/`

## Goals
- Extract assessment details from PDF and implement required solutions.
- Deliver well-documented, tested code and a clear submission package.

## Short-term (0–3 days)
1. Extract text from PDFs and create a task checklist.
2. Create a project skeleton (repo structure, virtualenv, basic README).
3. Implement highest-priority assessment tasks and add tests.

## Mid-term (4–10 days)
1. Complete remaining assessment tasks and integration tests.
2. Add examples, usage docs, and one-page summary for reviewers.
3. Polish code, run linters, and ensure cross-platform compatibility.

## Long-term / Optional
1. Add CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) to run tests and linters.
2. Provide a short demo or script that reproduces key results.

## Priorities
- Priority A: Extract tasks and deliver minimal working solutions.
- Priority B: Tests, documentation, and polish.
- Priority C: CI and optional extras.
